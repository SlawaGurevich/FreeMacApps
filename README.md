# FreeMacApps
Curated list of useful (free) Mac apps to make your life easier.

## Development

## Media Playback

### [IINA](https://iina.io/)
A modern video / music player akin to what MPlayerX was, but with way more options.

### [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html)
The classic choice for media playback on the Mac (or any other platform for this matter).

### [MPV](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv)
Another potent player for macOS and other platforms, albeit being a little unintuitive to configure.

## Office

## System Utilities

### [AppCleaner](http://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/)
The perfect app to completely remove apps from macOS. Even looks through ApplicationPreferences and ApplicationSupport folders to make sure the app is _really_ gone.
